🚀 This app was created as a test when I was starting to learn Java. In it, you can explore file directories, check the files within a directory, view the modification dates of the files, their respective sizes, names, and determine whether they are folders or other file types. Additionally, you can create new folders. If you double-click on a file, it opens its location. The default path is "D:\".
